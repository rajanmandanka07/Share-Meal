# Share-Meal
Share Meal is a compassionate project aimed at reducing food waste and supporting those in need by facilitating the donation of surplus food. The project serves as a platform for individuals and organizations to share meals with the less fortunate, promoting community engagement and social responsibility.

Share Meal's core functionality includes an intuitive interface for donors to list food items available for donation, specifying details such as quantity, expiry date, and any special instructions. Needy individuals or organizations can then browse these listings and request the food items they require.

The project also emphasizes sustainability by encouraging the donation of perishable items that would otherwise go to waste. Through Share Meal, users can contribute to reducing food waste while making a positive impact on the lives of others.

With a user-friendly design and a focus on accessibility, Share Meal aims to connect donors and recipients seamlessly, fostering a sense of unity and empathy within communities.
