# Share-Meal

Share Meal is a community-driven project designed to combat food waste and support those in need by creating a platform for donating surplus food. By connecting individuals and organizations with excess food to those who need it most, Share Meal fosters social responsibility and encourages community involvement. The platform enables the efficient sharing of food resources that might otherwise go to waste, helping to alleviate hunger and reduce the environmental impact of food disposal.

## Key Features

- **Recipient Access**:  
  Individuals or organizations in need can browse the available food listings, filtering by category, location, and urgency. They can then request items that fit their needs, ensuring that surplus food reaches those who can make use of it.

- **Sustainability Focus**:  
  One of the primary goals of Share Meal is to prevent food waste by encouraging the donation of perishable items before they spoil. This promotes sustainable food management practices, helping reduce the environmental footprint of wasted food while making a positive impact on people's lives.

- **User-Friendly Design**:  
  With a focus on accessibility, Share Meal ensures that the process of donating and receiving food is straightforward and seamless for all users, regardless of their tech-savviness. The platform's design emphasizes simplicity while ensuring rich functionality.

  A highly flexible and powerful JavaScript library used to build the user interface (UI). React ensures a smooth and responsive experience for users across various devices.

- **Bootstrap and CSS**:  
  These technologies are employed to design a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly layout. The use of Bootstrap ensures quick development of responsive, consistent UI components, while CSS allows for custom styling and enhancements.

- **Axios**:  
  Axios handles the communication between the frontend and backend, making HTTP requests to retrieve or send data to the server with ease.

### Backend:

- **Node.js and Express.js**:  
  The backend API is built using Node.js, a fast and scalable server environment, and Express.js, which simplifies routing, middleware management, and server-side logic. Together, they handle user authentication, food listings, and requests.

- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**:  
  JWT is used for secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated users can access specific features like managing donations or requests.

### Database:

- **MongoDB (NoSQL)**:  
  As a flexible and scalable NoSQL database, MongoDB is ideal for handling dynamic data such as user profiles, food donation listings, and transaction history. It allows easy storage and retrieval of data in real-time.

- **Mongoose ORM**:  
  Mongoose is used for managing data relationships, enforcing schema validation, and streamlining interactions with the MongoDB database.
